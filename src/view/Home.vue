    <p class="mb-5">Howdy there! It looks like you've stumbled into my little corner of the web. Welcome.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">I've been a software developer for a lifetime, and I also write. I've also been known to produce
      art and music from time to time, and I have a plethora of other interests and hobbies. I am the proud owner of a
      Pomeranian whom I love dearly. He's my second Pom, and wow, these dogs are packed with personality!</p>

    <p class="mb-5">I have worked with various programming languages, stacks, and technologies over the years. Everything
      from Perl to classic ASP, JSP, JS, TS, Go, Rust, C, Java, Flutter, Vue, Flex, ActionScript, MSSQL, Ingres, MongoDB,
      MySQL, and many, many others. I'm currently focused on Vue 3, TypeScript, and various associated libraries and
      tools. One of the first IDEs (editors) I used was BBEdit, and recently, I've been using IntelliJ and VSCode quite
      often. Way back in olden times, I was an Authorware programmer, and I've worked in e-learning for a good portion
      of my career. I've also worked as a developer supporting various aspects of movie production, from special effects
      to websites specifically for movies. I've done some game development (remember Club Penguin?) and also worked on
      command line applications. I've done quite a bit of UI design and development and find myself doing mostly front
      end work these days.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">I like to think I'm a pretty interesting human, and there's plenty more I could share. That's probably
    sufficient for now though. If you have any questions, please get in touch. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
