      <p class="mb-5">Throughout my career, I've functioned as a web, mobile, and desktop developer, technical writer, and reviewer, technical editor,
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020325160521/http://lioncorp.net/" target="_blank"> graphic</a>, and UI designer, and journalist.
        I've written on topics ranging from web development to crypto and Web3 to
        <a href="https://a-z-animals.com/author/seanmoore/" target="_blank">lakes</a> and
        <a href="https://www.homemusicmaker.com/fl-studio-ghost-notes" target="_blank"> digital audio production</a>. Some publishers
        I've had the privilege and honor of working with include <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/3485" target="_blank">O'Reilly Media</a>,
        Addison-Wesley, Pearson VUE, Adobe, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/sean-moore" target="_blank">Cointelegraph</a>,
        Packt Publishing, and Manning.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">Some companies I've had the utmost privilege and honor of working with as a developer include Adobe, Disney, Microsoft,
        Warner Bros., T-Mobile, and 2Advanced.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">In years gone by, I served as an Adobe Community Professional and was once an Adobe Flex Developer Champion. I'm also a
        certified ActionScript 1.0 and Flex Developer, even though those technologies are long gone and forgotten. My time working closely with
        Macromedia/Adobe Flash, ActionScript, and Flex formed the base for a deep love, appreciation, and understanding of application development.
        The similarities between modern Vue 3 and TypeScript compared to Flex and ActionScript 3.0 continue to astound me daily.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">I'm the creator/author of the original
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060207203712im_/http://www.actionscriptcheatsheet.com/actionscript_cheat_sheet.jpg" target="_blank">
          ActionScript Cheatsheets
        </a>.
        If you were a developer around 2006-2012 you more than
        likely saw the AS Cheatsheets or maybe even got a laminated one from me at a conference.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">Test driven development (TDD), development best practices, and coding standards are the foundation for a well rounded and
        sane development experience and have thus been a major focus throughout my career and life. I've written about and given presentations at
        conferences and user groups on these topics to share what I and many others have learned the hard way.</p>
