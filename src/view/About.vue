      <p class="mb-5">Throughout my career, I've functioned as a web, mobile, and desktop developer, technical writer, and <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flex-4-cookbook/9781449388195/pr03.html" target="_blank"> reviewer</a>, technical editor,
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020325160521/http://lioncorp.net/" target="_blank"> graphic</a>, and UI designer, and journalist.
        I've written on topics ranging from web development to crypto and Web3 to
        <a href="https://a-z-animals.com/author/seanmoore/" target="_blank">lakes</a> and
        <a href="https://www.homemusicmaker.com/fl-studio-ghost-notes" target="_blank"> digital audio production</a>. Some publishers
        I've had the privilege and honor of working with include <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/3485" target="_blank">O'Reilly Media</a>,
        Addison-Wesley, Pearson VUE, Adobe, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/sean-moore" target="_blank">Cointelegraph</a>,
        <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/en-ch/product/flash-development-for-android-cookbook-pref04-9781849691420/chapter/about-the-reviewers/about-the-reviewers" target="_blank"> Packt Publishing</a>, and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/adobe-air-in-action" target="_blank"> Manning</a>.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">I'm currently working with Vue 3, TypeScript, vuetify 3, and pinia, on a SASS application that enables users to manage and test
        SCORM conformant e-learning content from the Cloud.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">Some companies I've had the utmost privilege and honor of working with as a developer include Adobe, Disney, Microsoft,
        Warner Bros., T-Mobile, and 2Advanced.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">In years gone by, I served as an Adobe Community Professional and was once an Adobe Flex Developer Champion. I'm also a
        certified ActionScript 1.0 and Flex Developer, even though those technologies are long gone and forgotten. My time working closely with
        Macromedia/Adobe Flash, ActionScript, and Flex formed the base for a deep love, appreciation, and understanding of application development.
        The similarities between modern Vue 3 and TypeScript compared to Flex and ActionScript 3.0 continue to astound me daily.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">I'm the creator/author of the original
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060207203712im_/http://www.actionscriptcheatsheet.com/actionscript_cheat_sheet.jpg" target="_blank">
          ActionScript Cheatsheets
        </a>.
        If you were a developer around 2006-2012 you more than
        likely saw the AS Cheatsheets or maybe even got a laminated one from me at a conference.</p>

      <p class="mb-5">I spent a significant amount of time as an early advocate for source control, TDD, best practices and coding standards. I <a href="https://www.scribd.com/presentation/95139359/Sean-Moore-Flex-Best-Practices" target="_blank"> authored content</a>
      and provided sessions at multiple conferences and user groups teaching the development community about these topics.</p>

      <p>After many years in public facing, community oriented roles I took a step back and focused on fundamental software development concepts,
        technical writing and self development. I started my career with a focus on design and gravitated toward development over time. After years of working as a developer,
        I felt the need to learn more about deeper software engineering principals and topics and also hone my writing skills to improve my overall communication skills and
        abilities. I also placed too much emphasis on work and the grind in my early career. I took time to really discover who I am and how to better connect with the
        world around me. If there is one thing I could pass along to younger developers and people just starting a career it would be to mind your mental health and always
        strive to find and maintain a healthy work life balance. Don't make work your identify, and find hobbies and interests outside of software development.</p>
