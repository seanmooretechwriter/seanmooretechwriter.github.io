### Hello world!
What blog would be complete without its official Hello World post?

Well, here it is in all it's glory and splendor.

It's been quite some time since I maintained a blog. I'm not even sure 
when the last time was actually. Maybe a decade ago. Where does the time go?

I've had a couple blogs in the last decade, but nothing substantial and lasting.
I'm hoping that changes with this new blog. I built this blog with Vue 3, TypeScript, 
and some other sweet libraries and tools. Maybe that'll be enough motivation to keep
writing. I have been needing a place to write for quite some time.

I guess this first post will be nice, short and sweet. Thanks for stopping by and 
reading. I appreciate your time, and you!

It's pretty hot today here in the Seattle area. It's been a warm winter, and this
heat doesn't come as too much of a surprise. It does tell me this summer might be
filled with many hot days. Maybe another heat wave. Time will tell, as it always does.
